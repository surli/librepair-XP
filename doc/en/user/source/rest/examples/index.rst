REST configuration examples
===========================

This section contains a number of examples which illustrate various uses of the
:ref:`REST configuration API <rest_api>`.

The examples were originally grouped by the language or environment used:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   curl
   php
   python
   java
   ruby

But we're changing this to be based on endpoint:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   fonts
   layers
   styles

So this section is under construction.
