Description: Apache Syncope enduser Web Application
 Apache Syncope is an Open Source system for managing digital identities in enterprise environments,
 implemented in Java EE technology and released under Apache 2.0 license.
 Identity management (or IdM) represents the joint result of business process and IT to manage user data
 on systems and applications. IdM involves considering user attributes, roles, resources and
 entitlements in trying to give a decent answer to the question bumping up every time in an
 IT administrator's mind: Who has access to What, When, How, and Why?
