==== E-mail Configuration

The `mail.properties` holds the configuration options to enable the effective delivery of <<notifications,notification>>
e-mails:

* `smtpHost` - the mail server host, typically an SMTP host;
* `smtpPort` - the mail server port;
* `smtpUser` - (optional) the username for the account at the mail host;
* `smtpPassword` - (optional) the password for the account at the mail host;
* `smtpProtocol` - the mail protocol;
* `smtpEncoding` - the default encoding to use for MIME messages;
* `smtpConnectionTimeout` - the connection timeout value in milliseconds, to the mail host;
* `mailDebug` - when `true`, enable the debugging of email, including the handshake, authentication, delivery and
disconnection.

[NOTE]
In order to make the changes to `mail.properties` effective, the Java EE container needs to be restarted.

[WARNING]
Be sure to provide a sensible value for the `notificationjob.cronExpression` configuration parameter, otherwise
the <<tasks-notification, notification tasks>> will not be triggered; see <<configuration-parameters, below>> for
details.
