=== Domains

Domains are built to facilitate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy[multitenancy^].

Domains allow the physical separation of all data managed by Apache Syncope, by storing the data for different domains
into different database instances. Therefore, Apache Syncope can facilitate Users, Groups, Any Objects,
External Resources, Policies, Tasks, etc. from different domains (e.g. tenants) in a single <<core,core>> instance. 

By default, a single `Master` domain is defined, which also bears the configuration for additional domains.

[TIP]
====
Each domain's persistence unit can be configured to work with one of the <<persistence,supported DBMSes>>: `Master` can be
on MySQL, `Domain1` on PostgreSQL, `DomainN` on Oracle and so on.
