/**
 * {@link GraphRoadModel} that allows adding and removing connections and nodes
 * in the road graph. The {@link Graph} needs to be supplied as a
 * {@link ListenableGraph}. When the graph reports a change of its structure the
 * model will check whether the modification is allowed. There are two
 * situations in which a graph modification is not allowed:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Removal of a connection or changing a connection when a {@link RoadUser}
 * is on that connection.</li>
 * <li>Removal of the last connection to a node with a {@link RoadUser} on it.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * An {@link IllegalStateException} will be thrown upon detection of an invalid
 * modification. It is up to the user to prevent this from happening. The method
 * {@link #hasRoadUserOn(Point, Point)} can be of help for this. Instances can
 * be obtained via {@link RoadModelBuilders#dynamicGraph(ListenableGraph)}.
