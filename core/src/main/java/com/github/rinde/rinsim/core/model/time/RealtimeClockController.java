/**
 * Controller for manipulating a real-time clock. A real-time clock synchronizes
 * the simulation ticks to the real time. By default the clock runs in
 * real-time, but it has an option to switch to simulated time (using
 * {@link #switchToSimulatedTime()}). While in simulated time mode the ticks are
 * executed as fast as possible, time consistency is preserved by making sure
 * that each {@link TickListener} does not take more <i>computation time</i>
 * than is allowed according to the {@link TimeLapse} it receives. The
 * simulation mode can be used to 'fast forward' the simulation to a point in
 * time where it becomes relevant again to use the real-time mode (switching
 * back can be done via {@link #switchToRealTime()}).
 * <p>
 * To ensure further time consistency, {@link #tick()} is deprecated and the
 * clock can be started and stopped only once.
