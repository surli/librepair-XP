   * it can check whether the parameters for the
   * {@link SingleVehicleArraysSolver} are valid.
   * <p>
   * All times are in units relative to the current time (0). All constraints
   * are soft, i.e. lateness at service locations and at depot are allowed. The
   * start location has index 0, the end location (depot) has index n-1.

   * @param travelTime <code>n x n</code> distance matrix expressed in time:
   *          <code>travelTime[i][j]</code> specifies travelTime from location
   *          <code>i</code> to location <code>j</code>.
   * @param releaseDates specifies the left side of the time window for every
   *          location (hard constraint, earlier is not allowed).
   * @param dueDates specifies the right side of the time window for every
   *          location (soft constraint, lateness is allowed).
   * @param servicePairs <code>n x 2</code> matrix of service location pairs,
   *          <code>servicePairs[i][0]</code> and
   *          <code>servicePairs[i][1]</code> specify the pickup and delivery
   *          location respectively. Each location may occur at maximum once in
   *          the matrix (either as an pickup or as a delivery).
   * @param serviceTimes specifies the service time for all locations (both
   *          pickups and deliveries).
   * @param currentSolution If defined it contains the current route of the
   *          vehicle. This can be used as a starting point for a new solution.
   *          If any new parcels have become known since this current solution
   *          was computed these parcels will <i>not</i> be part of the
   *          solutions. This means that these solutions may not be feasible
   *          solutions and thus require adaptation.
   * @return The solution object which indicates a (usually the best found)
   *         solution for the single vehicle PDPTW.
