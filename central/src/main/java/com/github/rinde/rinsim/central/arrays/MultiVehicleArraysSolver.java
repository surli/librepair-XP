   * are valid.
   * <p>
   * All times are in units relative to the current time (0). All constraints
   * are soft, i.e. lateness at service locations and at depot are allowed. The

   *          is the number of vehicles and <code>n</code> is the number of
   *          locations. Contains travel times from each vehicle to every
   *          location. Value <code>vehicleTravelTimes[i][j]</code> indicates
   *          travel time from location of vehicle <code>i</code> to location
   *          <code>j</code>.
   * @param inventories <code>m x 2</code> matrix of vehicle and location pairs.
   *          Value at <code>inventories[i][0]</code> indicates the vehicle,
   *          <code>inventories[i][1]</code> indicates the location. Vehicles
   *          may occur more than once (i.e. they may have more than one
   *          location in their inventory). Only delivery locations can be in
   *          the inventory.
   * @param remainingServiceTimes contains the remaining service time for every
   *          vehicle. The length of this array equals the number of vehicles.
   *          When <code>remainingServiceTimes[i] &gt; 0</code> vehicle
   *          <code>i</code> will be servicing for the specified amount of time.
   *          The location it is currently servicing is defined by
   *          <code>currentDestinations[i]</code>. The length of this array
   *          equals the number of vehicles.
   * @param currentDestinations contains a pointer to a location which indicates
   *          the current destination for every vehicle (or its current service
   *          location). If the value is <code>0</code> for a vehicle, it means
   *          that the vehicle has no destination or service location. In case a
   *          vehicle has a destination, <b>the vehicle is obliged to continue
   *          traveling towards this destination and/or finish servicing it</b>.
   *          In case <code>remainingServiceTimes[i] &gt; 0</code> the value at
   *          <code>currentDestinations[i]</code> points to the current service
   *          location. The length of this array equals the number of vehicles.
   * @param currentSolutions If defined it contains a list of
   *          {@link SolutionObject}s containing the current routes of the
   *          vehicles. This can be used as a starting point for a new solution.
   *          If any new parcels have become known since these current solutions
   *          were computed these parcels will <i>not</i> be part of the
   *          solutions. This means that these solutions may not be feasible
   *          solutions and thus require adaptation.
   * @return A solution object for every vehicle. Each location may occur in
   *         only one route at a time. Routes must respect the inventories, i.e.
   *         a vehicle with a location in its inventory <i>must</i> have that
   *         location in its route.
