 * Real-time version of {@link com.github.rinde.rinsim.central.Solver Solver}. A

 * {@link #problemChanged(GlobalStateObject)}.
 * <p>
 * A {@link RealtimeSolver} can be used to schedule all vehicles in a simulation
 * via {@link RtCentral}, or it can be used to compute a route for a single
 * vehicle, this can be done by letting the vehicle implement
 * {@link RtSolverUser}.
 * <p>
 * When a {@link RealtimeSolver} is added to the simulation
 * {@link #init(Scheduler)} is called. Via this method a {@link Scheduler} is
 * made available that can be used to update the schedule of the vehicle(s).
 * Each time the problem definition changes,
 * {@link #problemChanged(GlobalStateObject)} is called with a new view of the
 * current state. Using the received {@link GlobalStateObject} a new route
 * assignment should be computed which can be set to the vehicle(s) using
 * {@link Scheduler#updateSchedule(GlobalStateObject, com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList)}

   * execution time of this method as short as possible and perform heavy
   * calculations in a different thread.</li>
